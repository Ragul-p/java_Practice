Scenario #2:
Expected Understanding: Interface, Class, static variables, dynamic binding
1) Create an interface called ‘Actor’
– Have variables boolean makeUpRequired
– Assign ‘true’ value for ‘makeUpRequired’
– Have variable String address.
– Assign value as “Chennai” to address.
– Have void methods act(), dance(), sing()

2) Create class named as ActorSivakumar with main method
– implement interface ‘Actor’ to this class.
– Give your own definitions for methods from interface
– Have static variable String address.
– Assign value to address as “Coimbatore”.
– Have instance method ‘speaking()’ with void return data type.
– Create instance for ActorSivakumar as below
ActorSivakumar as = new ActorSivakumar(65, “Audi Car”)
– Handle with proper Constructor
– Access all the methods from ActorSivakumar class
– Access variable address and print the value
– Create another instance of interface ‘Actor’ using dynamic binding approach
Actor ac = new Sivakumar();
– Handle with proper Constructor
– Access methods in ActorSivakumar class.
– Access variable address using ‘ac’ intance and print the value
– Observe and note down the difference between two instances
