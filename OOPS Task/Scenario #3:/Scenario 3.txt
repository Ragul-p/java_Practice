Scenario #3:
Expected Understanding: Abstraction, Inheritance, return keyword, Method Arguments, Constructor
1) Create an abstract class named ‘SmartPhone’
– Add the below abstract methods
– int call(int seconds)
– void sendMessage()
– void receiveCall()
– Add non abstract method void browse()
– print ‘SmartPhone browsing’ inside browse() method definition
– Have constructor as below.
   public SmartPhone()
   {
   System.out.println(“Smartphone under development”); 
   }
2) Create class called ‘FactoryDemo’ as abstract subclass of SmartPhone
– Add the below abstract methods
– void verifyFingerPrint()
– void providePattern()
– Add non abstract method void browse()
– print ‘Factory Demo browsing’ inside browse() method definition
– Add variable boolean isOriginalPiece and assign ‘false’ as value.
– Add static variable int price and set value as 0.
3) Create class called ‘Samsung’ with main method as sub class of FactoryDemo.
– Add unimplemented methods
– Add static variable int price and set value as 5000.
– Create instance for Samsung class called sam
– Access browse() method using sam instance.
– Access price variable using sam instance.
– Observe which method is called and note down.
