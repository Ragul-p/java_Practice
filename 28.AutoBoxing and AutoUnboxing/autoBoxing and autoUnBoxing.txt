Autoboxing and Unboxing:

Autoboxing:-
    1.The automatic conversion of primitive data types into its equivalent Wrapper type is known as auto boxing 
    2.new feature of Java5.



Eg:-
   1.int to Integer, long to Long, double to Double
       {
        int a=50;  
        Integer a2=new Integer(a);//Boxing  
  
        Integer a3=5;//Boxing
        }






Auto Unboxing:-
    1.The automatic conversion  object of a  Wrapper types into its equivalent primitive data type is known as auto Unboxing 


Eg:-
   1.Integer to int, Long to long, Double to double 
        {

        Integer i=new Integer(50);  
        int a=i;  
         
        }




Advantage of Autoboxing and Unboxing:-
       1.No need of conversion between primitives and Wrappers manually so less coding is required.




Autoboxing and Unboxing with method overloading:-
      some rules for method overloading with boxing:

    1.Widening beats boxing
    2.Widening beats varargs
    3.Boxing beats varargs
