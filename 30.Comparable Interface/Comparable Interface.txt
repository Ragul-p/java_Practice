Comparable Interface:-
    1.Java Comparable interface is used to order the objects of the user-defined class
    2.java.lang package
    3.contains only one method named compareTo(Object) 
    4.It provides a single sorting sequence only




compareTo(Object obj) method:-
  public int compareTo(Object obj): It is used to compare the current object with the specified object. 

It returns,
    positive integer, if the current object is greater than the specified object.
    negative integer, if the current object is less than the specified object.
    zero, if the current object is equal to the specified object.



We can sort the elements of:
    1.String objects
    2.Wrapper class objects
    3.User-defined class objects



Note:-
   1.if we want to comparare two objects of sam class 
   2.that particular class should implement 'Comparable Interface' Interface.
   3.Otherwise,We cannot go with Comparison
