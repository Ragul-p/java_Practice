For Loop:-

   1.for loop is a repetition control structure 
   2.that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to be executed a specific number of times.




Syntax:-

for(initialization; Boolean_expression; update)
{
   // Statements
}



The flow of control in a for loop:âˆ’

1.initialization step is executed first, and only once.
  This step allows you to declare and initialize any loop control variables and 
  this step ends with a semi colon (;).



2.Boolean expression is evaluated. 
  Is true, the body of the loop is executed.
  Is false, the body of the loop will not be executed 
  and control jumps to the next statement past the for loop.


3.After the body of the for loop gets executed, 
  the control jumps back up to the update statement. 
  This statement allows you to update any loop control variables. 
  This statement can be left blank with a semicolon at the end.


 The Boolean expression is now evaluated again. 
 If it is true, the loop executes and 
 the process repeats (body of loop, then update step, then Boolean expression). 
 After the Boolean expression is false, the for loop terminates.
