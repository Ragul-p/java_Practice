Covariant:-
      
     1.Covariant return type refers to return type of an overriding method
     2.Covariant return type works only for non-primitive return types.
     3.covariant is not mandatory for the methods in the superclass and subclass to have the same return type.
     4.Java 5 onwards --->we can override a method by changing its return type

Principle:-
     Co-variant return type is based on Liskov substitution principle.
 




 Invariant(மாறுபாட்டில்):-                                                    Covariant(இணை மாறுபாடு):-

      Before JDK 5.0                                                            After JDK 5.0

     1.not possible to override a method                                       1.It is possible to have different return
       by changing the return type                                               type for a overriding method in child class


     2.parent class method return type of the                                  2.but child’s return type should be
       overriding method in child class has to                                   sub-type of parent’s return type
       be exactly same as parent class


     3.Overriding method was said to be invariant                              3.Overriding method becomes variant
       with respect to return type                                                with respect to return type.
