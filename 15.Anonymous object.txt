Anonymous object:-
      1.An object which has no reference variable is called anonymous object
      2.Anonymous means nameless
      3.If you want to create only one object in a class then the anonymous object is a good approach.


Eg;-
    new Student(); 
    new Student(“Shubh”);



     new Student().display();
     new Student().display(“Shubh”, 25);
