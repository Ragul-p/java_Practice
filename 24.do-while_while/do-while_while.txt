1.do-while:-
    1.do-while loop is used to iterate(மீண்டும் செய்யவும்) a part of the program repeatedly until the specified condition is true
    2.do-while loop is also called Exit control loop
    3.do-while loop is executed at least once because condition is checked after loop body

Eg:-

   do{    
 
     }
   while (condition);    



Java Infinitive do-while Loop:-
    1.If you pass true in the do-while loop
    2.it will be infinitive do-while loop


Eg:-

   do{  
 
     }
   while(true);  





2.while:-
    1.while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until the specified Boolean condition is true
    2.Boolean condition becomes false, the loop automatically stops.

Eg:-

   while (condition)
         {    

         }  

Java Infinitive While Loop:-
     1.If you pass true in the while loop
     2.it will be infinitive while loop

Eg:-

      while(true)
           {  
 
            }
