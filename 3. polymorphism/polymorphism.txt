Polymorphism:-
 1.single action in different ways
 2.TwoGreek words: poly and morphs
 3.The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.
 

Real life example of polymorphism: 
    A person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.


Two types:-
     1.Compile time Polymorphism-static polymorphism-Method Overloading
           i.same method name with different no of arguments
		   ii.with different type of arguments

     2.Runtime Polymorphism-Dynamic polymorphism-method overriding
            i.same method name with same no of arguments
			ii.Method Overriding is redefining a super class method in a sub class.
			
			
      
			
method overloading                                   method overriding

1.It is occur within the class.                    1.It is performed in two classes with inheritance relationship.

2.methods must have same name and different        2.methods must have same name and same signature.
signature.                                 

3.Method overloading is the example of compile     3.Method overriding is the example of run time polymorphism.
time polymorphism.
