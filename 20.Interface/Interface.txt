Interface:-
      Interface is not class.
      Keyword:interface

What is interface ?
      1.set of rules / contract
      2.An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class
      3.It has static constants and abstract methods

Why use Interface ?
     1. It is used to achieve abstraction.
     2. By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
     3. It can be used to achieve loose coupling.


   1.Interface variables are public, static and final by default
   2.methods are public and abstract by default

interface Printable                            interface Printale
{                                              {
int MIN=5;                                     public static final int MIN=5;
void print();                                  public abstract void print();
}                                              }




The relationship between classes and interfaces
      1.class extends class
      2.class implements interface
      3.inerface extends interface


Multiple inheritance in Java by interface
      1.class implements interface,interface
      2.interface extends interface,interface
